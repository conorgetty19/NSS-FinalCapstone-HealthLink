## Introduction
Healthlink is a full-stack social media website utilizing React on the front-end and an ASP.Net web API on the serverside. The relational database is managed with SQLExpress. Authentication is handled by firebase.

This website is for anyone who wants to get fitter with their friends. Users can create and join social groups that take part in fitness-based challenges. As a valid group member, users can join any active challenge. They will then be able to log and update their results until the challenge ends. 
Additionally, the platform could be used to manage scheduled meetups. For example, a yoga teacher might use a "challenge" as a way to estimate attendance for the next class.
